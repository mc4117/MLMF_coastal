"""
 This file runs the Monte Carlo algorithm using XBeach for the non-breaking wave test case. 
 
 Note that this file must be run multiple times to generate a sufficient number of outputs 
 to verify the MLMF and MLMC results.
 
 This test case was first presented in

 Carrier, G.F., Greenspan, H.P., 1958. Water waves of finite amplitude on a sloping beach. Journal of Fluid Mechanics 4, 97â€“109.
 
 The uncertain parameter here is the slope and the variable of interest is the maximum run-up height.
